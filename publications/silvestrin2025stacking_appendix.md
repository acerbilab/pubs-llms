## A.1. Related work

Our work addresses the challenge of building global posterior approximations by combining local solutions from the VBMC framework (Acerbi, 2018, 2019, 2020). While the idea of combining posterior distributions has been explored before, previous approaches differ substantially in their goals and methodology. Yao et al. (2022) propose a similar "stacking" approach, but focus on optimising predictive performance through a leave-one-out strategy, whereas S-VBMC optimises the ELBO on the full dataset, allowing treatment of the logjoint as a black box. Other relevant approaches include variational boosting (Guo et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2017; Campbell and Li, 2019), which sequentially builds a mixture posterior by running variational inference multiple times on the whole dataset, and embarrassingly parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (Neiswanger et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015; Scott et al., 2022; De Souza et al., 2022), which combines parallel "sub-posteriors" obtained from data subsets. Our method differs from variational boosting through its inherent parallel and surrogate-based approach, offering significant computational advantages, and from embarrassingly parallel inference methods by using the complete dataset in each run, thus remaining robust to individual run failures.

## A.2. Model descriptions

GMM target. Our synthetic GMM target consists of a mixture of 20 bivariate Gaussian components arranged in four distinct clusters. The cluster centroids were positioned at $(-8,-8),(-7,7),(6,-6)$ and $(5,5)$. Around each centroid, we placed five Gaussian components with means drawn from $\mathcal{N}\left(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{c}, \mathbf{I}\right)$, where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{c}$ is the respective cluster centroid and $\mathbf{I}$ is the $2 \times 2$ identity matrix. Each component was assigned unit marginal variances and a correlation coefficient of $\pm 0.5$ (randomly selected with equal probability). This configuration produces an irregular mixture structure that requires a substantial number of components to approximate accurately. All components were assigned equal mixing weights of $1 / 20$. The resulting distribution is illustrated in Figure A. 1 (top panels).

Ring target. Our second synthetic target is a ring-shaped distribution defined by the probability density function

$$
p_{\text {ring }}\left(\theta_{1}, \theta_{2}\right) \propto \exp \left(-\frac{(r-R)^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}\right)
$$

where $r=\sqrt{\left(\theta_{1}-c_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(\theta_{2}-c_{2}\right)^{2}}$ represents the radial distance from centre $\left(c_{1}, c_{2}\right), R$ is the ring radius, and $\sigma$ controls the width of the annulus. We set $R=8, \sigma=0.1$, and centred the ring at $\left(c_{1}, c_{2}\right)=(1,-2)$. The small value of $\sigma$ produces a narrow annular distribution that challenges VBMC's exploration capabilities. The resulting distribution is shown in Figure A. 1 (bottom panels).

Neuronal model. Our first real-world problem involved fitting five biophysical parameters of a detailed compartmental model of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron. The model was constructed based on experimental data comprising a three-dimensional morphological reconstruction and electrophysiological recordings of neuronal responses to current injections. The deterministic neuronal responses were simulated using the NEURON simulation environment (Hines and Carnevale, 1997; Hines et al., 2009), applying current step inputs that matched the experimental protocol. The model's parameters characterise key biophysical properties: intracellular axial resistivity $\left(\theta_{1}\right)$, leak current reversal potential $\left(\theta_{2}\right)$, somatic leak conductance $\left(\theta_{3}\right)$, dendritic conductance gradient $\left(\theta_{4}\right.$, per $\left.\mu \mathrm{m}\right)$, and a dendritic surface scaling factor $\left(\theta_{5}\right)$. Based on independent measurements of membrane potential fluctuations, observation noise was modelled as a stationary Gaussian process with zero mean and a covariance function estimated from the data. The covariance structure was captured by the product of a cosine and an exponentially decaying function. For a similar approach applied to cerebellar Golgi cells, see Szoboszlay et al. (2016).

Multisensory causal inference model. Perceptual causal inference involves determining whether multiple sensory stimuli originate from a common source, a problem of particular interest in computational cognitive neuroscience (KÃ¶rding et al., 2007). Our second real-world problem involved fitting a visuo-vestibular causal inference model to empirical data from a representative participant (S1 from Acerbi et al., 2018). In each trial, participants seated in a moving chair reported whether they perceived their movement direction ( $s_{\text {vest }}$ ) as congruent with an experimentally-manipulated looming visual field ( $s_{\text {vis }}$ ). The model assumes participants receive noisy sensory measurements, with vestibular information $z_{\text {vest }} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(s_{\text {vest }}, \sigma_{\text {vest }}^{2}\right)$ and visual information $z_{\text {vis }} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(s_{\text {vis }}, \sigma_{\text {vis }}^{2}(c)\right)$, where $\sigma_{\text {vest }}^{2}$ and $\sigma_{\text {vis }}^{2}$ represent sensory noise variances. The visual coherence level $c$ was experimentally manipulated across three levels $\left(c_{\text {low }}, c_{\text {med }}, c_{\text {high }}\right)$. The model assumes participants judge the stimuli as having a common cause when the absolute difference between sensory measurements falls below a threshold $\kappa$, with a lapse rate $\lambda$ accounting for random responses. The model parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ comprise the visual noise parameters $\sigma_{\text {vis }}\left(c_{\text {low }}\right), \sigma_{\text {vis }}\left(c_{\text {med }}\right), \sigma_{\text {vis }}\left(c_{\text {high }}\right)$, vestibular noise $\sigma_{\text {vest }}$, lapse rate $\lambda$, and decision threshold $\kappa$ (Acerbi et al., 2018).

# A.3. Metrics description 

Following Acerbi (2020); Li et al. (2024), we evaluate our method using three metrics:

---

#### Page 12

1. The absolute difference between true and estimated log marginal likelihood ( $\Delta \mathrm{LML}$ ), where values $<1$ are considered negligible for model selection (Burnham and Anderson, 2003).
2. The mean marginal total variation distance (MMTV), which measures the average (lack of) overlap between true and approximate posterior marginals across dimensions:

$$
\operatorname{MMTV}(p, q)=\frac{1}{2 D} \sum_{d=1}^{D} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left|p_{d}\left(x_{d}\right)-q_{d}\left(x_{d}\right)\right| d x_{d}
$$

where $p_{d}$ and $q_{d}$ denote the marginal distributions along the $d$-th dimension.
3. The "Gaussianised" symmetrised KL divergence (GsKL), which evaluates differences in means and covariances between the approximate and true posterior:

$$
\operatorname{GsKL}(p, q)=\frac{1}{2 D}\left[D_{\mathrm{KL}}(\mathcal{N}[p] \|\mathcal{N}[q])+D_{\mathrm{KL}}\left(\mathcal{N}[q] \|\mathcal{N}[p])\right]\right.
$$

where $\mathcal{N}[p]$ denotes a Gaussian with the same mean and covariance as $p$.
We consider MMTV $<0.2$ and $\operatorname{GsKL}<\frac{1}{8}$ as target thresholds for reasonable posterior approximation (Li et al., 2024). Ground-truth values are obtained through numerical integration, extensive MCMC sampling, or analytical methods as appropriate for each problem.

# A.4. Black-box variational inference implementation 

Our implementation of black-box variational inference (BBVI) follows Li et al. (2024). For gradient-free black-box models, we cannot use the reparameterisation trick (Kingma and Welling, 2013) to estimate ELBO gradients. Instead, we employ the score function estimator (REINFORCE; Ranganath et al., 2014) with control variates to reduce gradient variance.

The variational posterior is parameterised as a mixture of Gaussians (MoG) with either $K=50$ or $K=500$ components, matching the form used in VBMC. We initialise component means near the origin by adding Gaussian noise $(\sigma=0.1)$ and set all component variances to 0.01 . We optimise the ELBO using Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with stochastic gradients, performing a grid search over Monte Carlo sample sizes $\{1,10,100\}$ and learning rates $\{0.01,0.001\}$. We select the best hyperparameters based on the estimated ELBO.

For fair comparison with VBMC, we set the target evaluation budget to $2000(D+2)$ and $3000(D+2)$ evaluations for noiseless and noisy problems respectively, matching the maximum evaluations used by 40 VBMC runs in total.

# A.5. Additional experiment results 

We present a comprehensive comparison of S-VBMC against VBMC and BBVI in Tables A. 1 and A.2, complementing the visualisations in Figures 2 and 3. For both synthetic problems (Table A.1) and real-world problems (Table A.2), S-VBMC generally demonstrates consistently improved posterior approximation metrics compared to both baselines. However, we observe an increase in $\Delta$ LML error with larger numbers of stacked runs. This increase likely stems from the accumulation of ELBO estimation bias, a phenomenon we analyse in detail in Appendix A.7.

## A.6. Example posterior visualisations

Figure A. 1 illustrates how S-VBMC significantly improves the result of a single VBMC run, capturing a larger portion of the target posterior mass as more runs are stacked together.

Figure A.1: Examples of overlap between the ground truth and the posterior when combining different numbers of VBMC runs. The red points indicate samples from the posterior approximation, with the target density depicted with colour gradients in the background.

We further use 'corner plots' (Foreman-Mackey, 2016) to visualise exemplar posterior approximations from different algorithms, including S-VBMC, VBMC and BBVI. These plots depict both one-dimensional marginal distributions and all pairwise two-dimensional marginals of the posterior samples. Example results are shown in Figures A.2, A.3, A.4, and A.5, where orange contours and points represent posterior samples obtained from different algorithms while the black contours and points represent ground truth samples. S-VBMC consistently improves the posterior approximations over standard VBMC and generally outperforms BBVI, showing a closer alignment with the target posterior.

> **Image description.** The image contains four panels, each displaying a set of plots related to VBMC (Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo) and S-VBMC (Sequential VBMC) methods. Each panel consists of three plots: a 2D plot in the center and two histograms, one above and one to the right of the 2D plot.
> 
> *   **Panel (a): VBMC**

> 
> *   **Panel (d): S-VBMC (20 runs, noisy)**
>     *   The central plot shows a 2D representation with a ring-shaped distribution, similar to (b) but with a more pixelated appearance, indicating noise. There are orange contours visible within the ring.
>     *   The top plot is a histogram of x1 values, showing black and orange distributions.
>     *   The right plot is a histogram of x2 values, with black and orange distributions.
>     *   The panel is labeled "(d) S-VBMC (20 runs, noisy)" below the central plot.
> 
> In summary, the image compares the performance of VBMC and S-VBMC methods, both with and without noise, by visualizing the distributions of x1 and x2. The S-VBMC method appears to produce more refined distributions, even in the presence of noise. The orange distributions appear to represent the learned distributions, while the black distributions may represent the true distributions.

> **Image description.** The image presents a figure composed of four panels, arranged in a 2x2 grid. Each panel displays a visualization of a posterior distribution, likely from a Bayesian inference process. Each panel contains three subplots: a 2D scatter plot in the center, and two histograms positioned above and to the right of the scatter plot, representing marginal distributions.
> 
> *   **Panel Structure:** Each panel is structured identically:
>     *   The central plot is a 2D scatter plot with axes labeled x1 and x2, ranging from -6 to 6. The data points form a ring-like structure, with varying density indicated by grayscale shading. There are also some contour lines overlaid on the scatter plot in the top left panel.
>     *   The top subplot is a histogram representing the marginal distribution of x1. It displays two histograms, one in black and one in orange.
>     *   The right subplot is a histogram representing the marginal distribution of x2. It also displays two histograms, one in black and one in orange.
> 
> *   **Panel Labels:** Each panel has a label below it indicating the method used and parameters:
>     *   Panel (e): "BBVI, MoG (K = 50)"
>     *   Panel (f): "BBVI, MoG (K = 500)"
>     *   Panel (g): "BBVI, MoG (K = 50), noisy"
>     *   Panel (h): "BBVI, MoG (K = 500), noisy"
> 
> *   **Visual Differences:** The main differences between the panels are in the shape and smoothness of the histograms, and the density of the points in the ring-like structure in the scatter plots. The panels labeled "noisy" appear to have a less defined ring structure and more spread in the distributions. The panels with K=500 appear to have sharper histograms.

# A.7. ELBO bias 

Here we analyse the ELBO overestimation observed in our results through a simplified example that illustrates one potential mechanism for this bias. While other factors may contribute, this analysis provides insight into why the bias tends to increase with the number of merged VBMC runs.

Consider $M$ VBMC runs that return identical posteriors each with a single component. The stacked posterior takes the form:

$$
q_{\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\sum_{m=1}^{M} \hat{w}_{m} q_{m}(\boldsymbol{\theta})
$$

For each single-component posterior, the expected log-joint is approximated as

$$
I_{m}=\mathbb{E}_{q \boldsymbol{\phi}_{m}}[\log p(\mathcal{D} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}) p(\boldsymbol{\theta})] \approx \mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}_{m}}}\left[f_{m}(\boldsymbol{\theta})\right]
$$

where $f_{m}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is the surrogate log-joint from the $m$-th VBMC run. Since all posteriors share identical parameters, their entropies are equal:

$$
\mathcal{H}\left[q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}_{1}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})\right]=\mathcal{H}\left[q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}_{2}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})\right]=\ldots=\mathcal{H}\left[q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}_{M}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})\right]
$$

The stacked posterior is thus a mixture of identical components with different associated values $I_{m}$. The optimal mixture weights $\hat{\mathbf{w}}$ depend solely on the noisy estimates of $I_{m}$ :

$$
\hat{I}_{m}=\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi_{m}}}\left[f_{m}(\boldsymbol{\theta})\right]=\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi_{m}}}[\log p(\mathcal{D} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}) p(\boldsymbol{\theta})]+\epsilon_{m}
$$

where $\epsilon_{m} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, J_{m}\right)$ represents estimation noise with variance $J_{m}$. Since all posteriors are identical and derived from the same data and model, differences in expected log-joint estimates arise purely from noise deriving from the Gaussian process surrogates $f_{m}$.

Given that entropy remains constant under merging, optimizing $\mathrm{ELBO}_{\text {stacked }}$ reduces to selecting the posterior with the highest expected log-joint estimate. If we denote $\hat{I}_{\max }=$ $\max _{m} \hat{I}_{m}$, the optimal ELBO becomes

$$
\operatorname{ELBO}_{\text {stacked }}^{*}=\hat{I}_{\max }+\mathcal{H}\left[q_{\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})\right]
$$

Since the true expected log-joint is identical across posteriors, the optimisation selects the most overestimated value. The magnitude of this overestimation increases with both $M$ and the observation noise for $f_{m}$, introducing a positive bias in $\mathrm{ELBO}_{\text {stacked }}^{*}$ that grows with the number of stacked runs and is more substantial for surrogates of noisy log-likelihoods.

While this simplified scenario does not capture the complexity of practical applications - where posteriors have multiple, non-overlapping components - it illustrates a fundamental issue: if we model each $\hat{I}_{m, k}$ as the sum of the true $I_{m, k}$ and noise, the merging process will favour overestimated components, biasing the final $\mathrm{ELBO}_{\text {stacked }}$ estimate upward. Further work is needed to develop debiasing techniques to counteract this tendency.
